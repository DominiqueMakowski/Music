Well, I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind
I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time
But I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
I feel there's nothing I can do, yeah

I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
After all I knew, it had to be something to do with you
I really don't mind what happens now and then
As long as you'll be my friend at the end

<b>If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite</b>

You called me strong, you called me weak
But still your secrets, I will keep
You took for granted all the times, I never let you down
You stumbled in and bumped your head
If not for me then you'd be dead
I picked you up and put you back on solid ground

25 years and my life is still
Tryin' to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination

I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
For whatever that means

And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out what's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar

And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
"What's going on?"

<b>And I say, hey-ey-ey, Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey, 
what's going on?"

And I try
Oh my God, do I try
I try all the time

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself. I'm sorry
I hope that you're well

Are running out of time

He was a boy, She was a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
He was a punk, She did ballet
What more can I say?

He wanted her, She'd never tell
Secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends, Stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes

<b>He was a skater boy
She said, "See you later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face
But her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to earth [Bb]</b>

Five years from now, She sits at home
Feeding the baby, she's all alone
She turns on TV, Guess who she sees
Skater boy rockin' up MTV

She calls up her friends, They already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along, And stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down

<b>He was a skater boy
She said, "See you later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a super star
Slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?
[Bb]</b>

<i>Sorry, girl, but you missed out
Well, tough, luck that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends
This is how the story ends
Too bad that you couldn't see
See the man that boy could be
There is more that meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside</i>

<i>He's just a boy
And I'm just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
We are in love
Haven't you heard
How we rock each other's world</i>

<b>I'm with the skater boy
I said, "See you later, boy"
I'll be back stage after the show
I'll be at a studio
Singing the song we wrote
About a girl he used to know

Elle cache dans son sac un joli couteau
Pour oublier cette nuit à se taire à se tordre
Elle se taillade les veines, les veines

<i>Tu souris et tu paies, tu paies
Chaque fois c'est un peu pareil

Moi j'ai mes idées noires et puis ma libido

This is for the ones who stood their ground
For Tommy and Gina, who never backed down
Tomorrow's getting harder, make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky, got to make your own breaks

<b>CHORUS</b>

<i>Better stand tall when they're calling you out
Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down</i>

        lyrics: `
There lived a certain man in Russia long ago
He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear
But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear
He could preach the bible like a preacher
Full of ecstacy and fire
But he also was the kind of teacher
Women would desire

<b>Ra ra Rasputin
Lover of the Russian queen
There was a cat that really was gone
Ra ra Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on</b>

He ruled the Russian land and never mind the Czar
But the kasachok he danced really wunderbar
In all affairs of state he was the man to please
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze
For the queen he was no wheeler dealer
Though she'd heard the things he'd done
She believed he was a holy healer
Who would heal her son

<b>CHORUS</b> 

<i>[Spoken:]
But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger for power 
became known to more and more people, 
the demands to do something about this outrageous man 
became louder and louder.</i>

"This man's just got to go!" declared his enemies
But the ladies begged "Don't you try to do it, please"
No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms
Though he was a brute they just fell into his arms
Then one night some men of higher standing
Set a trap, they're not to blame
"Come to visit us" they kept demanding
And he really came

<b>Ra ra Rasputin
Lover of the Russian queen
They put some poison into his wine
Ra ra Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
He drank it all and he said "I feel fine"
Ra ra Rasputin
Lover of the Russian queen
They didn't quit, they wanted his head
Ra ra Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
And so they shot him till he was dead</b>

Oh, those russians.

Where have all the good men gone
And where are all the gods?
Where's the streetwise Hercules
To fight the rising odds?
Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed
Late at night, I toss and I turn
And I dream of what I need

<b>I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night
He's gotta be strong, and he's gotta be fast
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light
He's gotta be sure, and it's gotta be soon
And he's gotta be larger than life
(Larger than life)</b>

Somewhere after midnight
In my wildest fantasy
Somewhere, just beyond my reach
There's someone reaching back for me
Racing on the thunder
And rising with the heat
It's gonna take a Superman to sweep me off my feet, yeah

<b>CHORUS</b>

<i>Up where the mountains meet the heavens above
Out where the lightning splits the sea
I could swear there is someone, somewhere watching me
Through the wind and the chill and the rain
And the storm and the flood
I can feel his approach like a fire in my blood
(Like a fire in my blood) x3</i>
