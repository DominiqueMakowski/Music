Well, I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind
I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time
But I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
I feel there's nothing I can do, yeah

I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
After all I knew, it had to be something to do with you
I really don't mind what happens now and then
As long as you'll be my friend at the end

<b>If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite</b>

You called me strong, you called me weak
But still your secrets, I will keep
You took for granted all the times, I never let you down
You stumbled in and bumped your head
If not for me then you'd be dead
I picked you up and put you back on solid ground

25 years and my life is still
Tryin' to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination

I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
For whatever that means

And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out what's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar

And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
"What's going on?"

<b>And I say, hey-ey-ey, Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey,

Oh my God, do I try

Hello, how are you?

I hope that you're well

Are running out of time

He was a boy, She was a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
He was a punk, She did ballet
What more can I say?

He wanted her, She'd never tell
Secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends, Stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes

<b>He was a skater boy
She said, "See you later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face
But her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to earth [Bb]</b>

Five years from now, She sits at home
Feeding the baby, she's all alone
She turns on TV, Guess who she sees
Skater boy rockin' up MTV

She calls up her friends, They already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along, And stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down

<b>He was a skater boy
She said, "See you later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a super star
Slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?
[Bb]</b>

<i>Sorry, girl, but you missed out
Well, tough, luck that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends
This is how the story ends
Too bad that you couldn't see
See the man that boy could be
There is more that meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside</i>

<i>He's just a boy
And I'm just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
We are in love
Haven't you heard
How we rock each other's world</i>

<b>I'm with the skater boy
I said, "See you later, boy"
I'll be back stage after the show
I'll be at a studio
Singing the song we wrote
About a girl he used to know

Pour oublier cette nuit à se taire à se tordre
Elle se taillade les veines, les veines

<i>Tu souris et tu paies, tu paies
Chaque fois c'est un peu pareil

There lived a certain man in Russia long ago
He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear
But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear
He could preach the bible like a preacher
Full of ecstacy and fire
But he also was the kind of teacher
Women would desire

<b>Ra ra Rasputin
Lover of the Russian queen
There was a cat that really was gone
Ra ra Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on</b>

He ruled the Russian land and never mind the Czar
But the kasachok he danced really wunderbar
In all affairs of state he was the man to please
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze
For the queen he was no wheeler dealer
Though she'd heard the things he'd done
She believed he was a holy healer
Who would heal her son

<b>CHORUS</b> 

<i>[Spoken:]
But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger for power 
became known to more and more people, 
the demands to do something about this outrageous man 
became louder and louder.</i>

"This man's just got to go!" declared his enemies
But the ladies begged "Don't you try to do it, please"
No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms
Though he was a brute they just fell into his arms
Then one night some men of higher standing
Set a trap, they're not to blame
"Come to visit us" they kept demanding
And he really came

<b>Ra ra Rasputin
Lover of the Russian queen
They put some poison into his wine
Ra ra Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
He drank it all and he said "I feel fine"
Ra ra Rasputin
Lover of the Russian queen
They didn't quit, they wanted his head
Ra ra Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
And so they shot him till he was dead</b>

Oh, those russians.

remember the film And as

we both kinda liked it"
And I said, "Well, that's, 
the one thing we've got"</b>

I see you, the only one who knew me
But now your eyes see through me
I guess I was wrong

So what now? It's plain to see we're over
And I hate when things are over
When so much is left undone

This life has many shades
I'd wake up every morning and before I'd start each day
I'd take a drag from last night's cigarette

Down a little something and then be on my way

I traveled far and wide
And laid this head in many ports
I was guided by a compass
I saw beauty to the north
I drew the tales of many lives
And wore the faces of my own
I had these memories all around me
So I wouldn't be alone

I've got your name written here

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance" (D)

I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?

She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Cèilidh singing to trad tunes

I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet
A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night

I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write

How can you see into my eyes, like open doors
Leading you down into my core
Where I've become so numb, 
without a soul
My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home

<b>(Wake me up)
Wake me up inside 
(I can't wake up)
Wake me up inside
(Save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark,
(Wake me up)
Bid my blood to run, 
(I can't wake up)
Before I come undone,
(Save me)
Save me from the nothing I've become</b>

Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real, bring me to life

<b>CHORUS (C - D - Em)
Bring me to life, 
(I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside),
Bring me to life</b>

<i>Frozen inside without your touch
Without your love, darling
Only you are the life among the dead</i>

<i>(rap)
All this time, I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems
I've got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
Don't let me die here
There must be something wrong</i>

(Am - D) Bring me to life

To przecież on z kościołów zrobił kina
i depcze krzyż, czerwoną gwiazdę czcząc.

To przecież on nie wierzyć w Boga zmusza

by człowieczeństwo w sercu twoim zgasło,

To przecież on zrabował twoje mienie

She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stare too long, I'd probably break down and cry

<b>Whoa, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine</b>

She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

Where do we go?

But when I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I hung my head and I cried.

<b>You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away</b>

I'll always love you and make you happy,
If you will only say the same.
But if you leave me and love another,
You'll regret it all some day

<b>CHORUS</b>

You told me once, dear, you really loved me
And no one else could come between.
But now you've left me and love another
You have shattered all of my dreams

<b>You were my sunshine, my only sunshine
You made me happy when skies were gray
You'll never know dear, how much I loved you
Now my sunshine’s gone away (x2)</b>

But you fit me better than my favourite sweater, and I know
That love is mean, and love hurts
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh baby!

<b>I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine

Love you more

I will love you 'til the end of time</b>

Big dreams, gangster
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like, “No please, stay here,
We don't need no money we can make it all work,”

I stayed up waitin', anticipatin', and pacin'
But he was chasing paper
"Caught up in the game" ‒ that was the last I heard

And baby that's alright
I told you that no matter what you did I'd be by your side
Cause Imma ride or die
Whether you fail or fly
Well shit at least you tried.
But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died
I told you I wanted more, but that's not what I had in mind
I just want it like before
We were dancing all night
Then they took you away, stole you out of my life
You just need to remember....</i>

One thing I don't know why
It doesn’t even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It’s so unreal
Didn’t look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on but didn’t even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when..

<b>I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter</b>

It doesn’t even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I’m surprised it got so (far)
Things aren’t the way they were before
You wouldn’t even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me
In the end
You kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when...
