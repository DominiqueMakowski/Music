        lyrics: `
Well, I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind
I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time
But I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
I feel there's nothing I can do, yeah

I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
After all I knew, it had to be something to do with you
I really don't mind what happens now and then
As long as you'll be my friend at the end

<b>If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite</b>

You called me strong, you called me weak
But still your secrets, I will keep
You took for granted all the times, I never let you down
You stumbled in and bumped your head
If not for me then you'd be dead
I picked you up and put you back on solid ground

25 years and my life is still
Tryin' to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination

I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
For whatever that means

And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out what's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar

And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
"What's going on?"

<b>And I say, hey-ey-ey, Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey, 
what's going on?"
x2</b>

And I try
Oh my God, do I try
I try all the time
In this institution

And I pray
Oh my God, do I pray
I pray every single day
For revolution

Bridge
<b>CHORUS x2</b>

25 years and my life is still
Tryin' to get up that great big hill of hope

We can go dancing, we can go walking, as long as we're together
Listen to some music, maybe just talking, get to know you better

<i>'Cos you know I've got - 
So much that I wanna do, when I dream I'm alone with you
It's magic
You want me to leave it there, afraid of a love affair
But I think you know
That I can't let go</i>

<b>If you change your mind, I'm the first in line
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around
If you've got no place to go, if you're feeling down
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie
If you put me to the test, if you let me try
Take a chance on me
Take a chance on me</b>

Oh you can take your time baby, I'm in no hurry, know I'm gonna get you
You don't wanna hurt me, baby don't worry, I ain't gonna let you

<i>Let me tell you now - 
My love is strong enough to last when things are rough
It's magic
You say that I waste my time but I can't get you off my mind
No I can't let 
go 'Cos I love you so</i>

<b>She leads a lonely life
She leads a lonely life</b>

When she woke up late in the morning light
And the day had just begun
She opened up her eyes and thought
Oh, what a morning 

It's not a day for work
It's a day for catching sun
Just laying on the beach and having fun
She's going to get you  

<b>All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby</b>

So if you are in sight and the day is right
She's a hunter, you're the fox
The gentle voice that talks to you
Won't talk forever

It is a night for passion
But the morning means goodbye
Beware of what is flashing in her eyes
She's going to get you
