Well, I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind
I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time
But I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
I feel there's nothing I can do, yeah

I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
After all I knew, it had to be something to do with you
I really don't mind what happens now and then
As long as you'll be my friend at the end

<b>If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite</b>

You called me strong, you called me weak
But still your secrets, I will keep
You took for granted all the times, I never let you down
You stumbled in and bumped your head
If not for me then you'd be dead
I picked you up and put you back on solid ground

25 years and my life is still
Tryin' to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination

I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
For whatever that means

And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out what's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar

And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
"What's going on?"

<b>And I say, hey-ey-ey, Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey,

Oh my God, do I try

Hello, how are you?

Are running out of time

He was a boy, She was a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
He was a punk, She did ballet
What more can I say?

He wanted her, She'd never tell
Secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends, Stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes

<b>He was a skater boy
She said, "See you later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face
But her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to earth [Bb]</b>

Five years from now, She sits at home
Feeding the baby, she's all alone
She turns on TV, Guess who she sees
Skater boy rockin' up MTV

She calls up her friends, They already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along, And stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down

<b>He was a skater boy
She said, "See you later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a super star
Slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?
[Bb]</b>

<i>Sorry, girl, but you missed out
Well, tough, luck that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends
This is how the story ends
Too bad that you couldn't see
See the man that boy could be
There is more that meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside</i>

<i>He's just a boy
And I'm just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
We are in love
Haven't you heard
How we rock each other's world</i>

<b>I'm with the skater boy
I said, "See you later, boy"
I'll be back stage after the show
I'll be at a studio
Singing the song we wrote
About a girl he used to know

Pour oublier cette nuit à se taire à se tordre
Elle se taillade les veines, les veines

<i>Tu souris et tu paies, tu paies
Chaque fois c'est un peu pareil

Luck ain't even lucky, got to make your own breaks

        lyrics: `
There lived a certain man in Russia long ago
He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear
But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear
He could preach the bible like a preacher
Full of ecstacy and fire
But he also was the kind of teacher
Women would desire

<b>Ra ra Rasputin
Lover of the Russian queen
There was a cat that really was gone
Ra ra Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on</b>

He ruled the Russian land and never mind the Czar
But the kasachok he danced really wunderbar
In all affairs of state he was the man to please
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze
For the queen he was no wheeler dealer
Though she'd heard the things he'd done
She believed he was a holy healer
Who would heal her son

<b>CHORUS</b> 

<i>[Spoken:]
But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger for power 
became known to more and more people, 
the demands to do something about this outrageous man 
became louder and louder.</i>

"This man's just got to go!" declared his enemies
But the ladies begged "Don't you try to do it, please"
No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms
Though he was a brute they just fell into his arms
Then one night some men of higher standing
Set a trap, they're not to blame
"Come to visit us" they kept demanding
And he really came

<b>Ra ra Rasputin
Lover of the Russian queen
They put some poison into his wine
Ra ra Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
He drank it all and he said "I feel fine"
Ra ra Rasputin
Lover of the Russian queen
They didn't quit, they wanted his head
Ra ra Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
And so they shot him till he was dead</b>

Oh, those russians.

This life has many shades
I'd wake up every morning and before I'd start each day

Down a little something and then be on my way

I traveled far and wide
And laid this head in many ports
I was guided by a compass
I saw beauty to the north
I drew the tales of many lives
And wore the faces of my own
I had these memories all around me
So I wouldn't be alone

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance" (D)

I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?

She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Cèilidh singing to trad tunes

I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet
A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine

I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write

How can you see into my eyes, like open doors
Leading you down into my core
Where I've become so numb,

My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home

Call my name and save me from the dark,
(Wake me up)
Bid my blood to run,

Before I come undone,
(Save me)
Save me from the nothing I've become</b>

Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real, bring me to life

Bring me to life,

Without your love, darling
Only you are the life among the dead</i>

All this time, I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems
I've got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
Don't let me die here
There must be something wrong</i>

To przecież on z kościołów zrobił kina

To przecież on nie wierzyć w Boga zmusza

She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stare too long, I'd probably break down and cry

<b>Whoa, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine</b>

She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

So I hung my head and I cried.

You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away</b>

I'll always love you and make you happy,
If you will only say the same.
But if you leave me and love another,
You'll regret it all some day

You told me once, dear, you really loved me
And no one else could come between.
But now you've left me and love another
You have shattered all of my dreams

You made me happy when skies were gray
You'll never know dear, how much I loved you

That love is mean, and love hurts
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh baby!

Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like, “No please, stay here,
We don't need no money we can make it all work,”

I stayed up waitin', anticipatin', and pacin'
But he was chasing paper

And baby that's alright

One thing I don't know why
It doesn’t even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It’s so unreal
Didn’t look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on but didn’t even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when..

<b>I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter</b>

It doesn’t even matter how hard you try

I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I’m surprised it got so (far)
Things aren’t the way they were before
You wouldn’t even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me

You kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart

(up rhythm)

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
And I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

<b>I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas
Is you</b>

Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
And I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Cause baby all I want for Christmas is you

Oh-ho, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby (Yeahhh)
Standing right outside my door

<b>Oh I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas is
You</b>

On a hippie trail, head full of zombie
I met a strange lady, she made me nervous
She took me in and gave me breakfast
And she said:

<b>Do you come from a land down under
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder
You better run, you better take cover</b>

Buying bread from a man in Brussels
He was six foot four and full of muscle
I said, "Do you speak-a my language?"
He just smiled and gave me a Vegemite sandwich
And he said:
<b>I come from a land down under
Where beer does flow and men chunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder
You better run, you better take cover</b>

Lying in a den in Bombay
With a slack jaw, and not much to say
I said to the man, "Are you trying to tempt me?
Because I come from the land of plenty"

I'll start this off without any words
I got so high that I scratched 'til I bled
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?

Was when I learned to cry on command
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?

<b>I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain</b>

My mother died every night
It's safe to say, don't quote me on that
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?

The black sheep got blackmailed again
Forgot to put on the zip code
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?

<i>Somewhere I have heard this before
In a dream my memory has stored
As a defense I'm neutered and spayed
What the hell am I trying to say?</i>

It is now time to make it unclear
To write off lines that don't make sense
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?

And one more special message to go
And then I'm done, then I can go home
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?

Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way

Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long, and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time

Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way

A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
Did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?
<b>How I wish, how I wish you were here.
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,
Running over the same old ground.
What have we found?
The same old fears.

Hey there, Delilah
What's it like in New York City?
I'm a thousand miles away
But girl, tonight you look so pretty
Yes you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you
I swear it's true

Hey there, Delilah
Don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely
Give this song another listen
Close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
I'm by your side

<b>Oh it's what you do to me x4</b>

Hey there, Delilah
I know times are getting hard
But just believe me, girl
Someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar
We'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good

Hey there, Delilah
I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you
Would take your breath away
I'd write it all
Even more in love with me you'd fall
We'd have it all

<b>Oh it's what you do to me x4</b>

<i>A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes and trains and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
and we'll just laugh along because we know
That none of them have felt this way
Delilah, I can promise you
That by the time that we get through
The world will never ever be the same
And you're to blame</i>

Hey there, Delilah
You be good and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school
And I'll be making history like I do
You'll know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to
Hey there, Delilah, here's to you
This one's for you

Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation
And little girls from Sweden dream of silver screen quotation

The sun may rise in the East at least it's settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication

Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication

Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station To Station?
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication

Born and raised by those who praise control of population
Well, everybody's been there and I don't mean on vacation

Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar, they're just another good vibration

Papa was a copper, and her mama was a hippy

What in the world does your company take me for?

Black bandanna, sweet Louisiana
Robbing on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner
Rebel, and a stunner
On her merry way saying baby, watcha gonna?
Looking down the barrel of a hot metal forty-five
Just another way to survive (Dm)

With a name like Dani California

A little loaded, she was stealing another breath

Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence.

"Fools," said I, "You do not know.
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you.
Take my arms that I might reach you."
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
whispered in the sounds of silence."

When love went blind and you would make me see
I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes
So that I knew you were there for me
Time after time you were there for me

<b>Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sand, I remember you
Through the sleepless nights and every endless days
I'd wanna hear you say, I remember you</b>

Wished ever after would be like this
You said I love you babe, without a sound

Dans les clubs il fait noir, mais il ne fait pas froid
Ne fait pas froid si t'y crois
Et j'y crois!

Les flaques de peinture sur les murs ont parfois
La couleur des sons que tu bois
Et puis c'est tellement grand que vite on oubliera
Que nulle part c'est chez moi, chez toi
Chez nous, quoi!

<b>CHORUS
Et tu m'emmèneras!</b>

Un jour (emmène-moi, mène-moi)
(Emmène-moi, mène-moi)
Un jour (toucher à ci, toucher à ça)
Voir si le cœur de la ville bat en moi

<b>Et tu m'emmèneras!
Emmène-moi!</b>

Lost the common sense,
Got a rave in my brain
Like I'm without defense.

It's a bloke of a girl, fine as she can be.
Hey cute from the left, oh yeah
What a move she had me shake out a lie
She really had it going
The crowd's getting thinner
We are getting closer,
With a hole in my head
She took me to her sofa

<b>Well now the sun ain't shining no more,
I don't know why but I've seen it before.
Ain't got no joy no girl to lean on,
She leaves my soul on the floor like a doll.  [G#]</b>

She was young, she was hot,
She made me feel alive.
So in love I was falling,
Ooh, it's early morning.
She took me in her hands
And squeezed me real tight.
I was humbled and so joyful
But depending on this gal
It didn't last very long,
A week or maybe two.
When she called me on the phone
Saying baby I don't love you.
Just another one way love
Always giving never get.
And now I feel so stupid
It's like a deja vu ooooooo

Since nineteen-sixteen
In your head, in your head, they're still fighting

With their tanks, and their bombs
And their bombs, and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are dying

<b>In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head

Now they're going to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his

Chest now, he takes off her
Dress now, let me go
And I just can't look, it's killing me
They're taking control

Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis

Went up to a party just the other night
But three hours later and seven shots of jäger
She was in the bedroom with another guy

And I don't really wanna know
So don't tell me anymore
And I really don't wanna hear
About her feet all up in the air
And well I'm not the one who acted like a hoe
Why must I be the one who has to know?
I'm not the one who messed up big time
So spare me the details if you don't mind

Now I can understand friends who wanna tell me
They think they're gonna help me, open up my eyes
But the play by play makes me wanna lose it
Every time you do it man, it turns the knife

And I don't need to hear about how long it was takin'

Missin' the tomorrow that we could have had
Running through my head, over and over
Things I never told her that just make me sad

And it drives me insane sittin with a vision
stuck with that image burned into my brain
And I feel so dumb that I could ever trust her
When someone else fucked her, then walked away

J'aime quand mon écorché est vivant 
Je ne donne pas long feu 
A nos tragédies, à nos adieux 
Reviens-moi, reviens moi 
Tu partiras mieux comme ça
 
<i>À force de se tordre, 
On en finirait par se mordre 
À quoi bon se reconstruire, 
Quand on est adepte du pire 
Malgré nous, Malgré nous, 
À quoi bon se sentir plus grand 
Que nous, deux grains de folie dans le vent 
deux âmes brulantes, deux enfants</i>

        lyrics: `
I can't believe the news today
Oh, I can't close my eyes and make it go away

How long, how long must we sing this song?
How long? How long?

'Cause tonight
We can be as one, Tonight

Broken bottles under children's feet
Bodies strewn across the dead-end street
But I won't heed the battle call
It puts my back up, puts my back up against the wall

<b>Sunday, Bloody Sunday x4</b>
And the battle's just begun
There's many lost, but tell me who has won?
The trenches dug within our hearts
And mothers, children, brothers, sisters torn apart

<b>Sunday, Bloody Sunday x2</b>
How long, how long must we sing this song?
How long? How long?

'Cause tonight we can be as one, tonight
<b>Sunday, Bloody Sunday x2</b>

And it's true we are immune
When fact is fiction and TV reality
And today the millions cry
We eat and drink while tomorrow they die

<b>Sunday, Bloody Sunday x4</b>

Somebody's Heine'
Is crowdin' my icebox
Somebody's cold one
Is givin' me chills
Guess I'll just close my eyes

Oh yeah, Alright, Feels good, Inside

Flip on the telly
Wrestle with Jimmy
Something is bubbling
Behind my back
The bottle is ready to blow

<b>Say it ain't so
Your drug is a heart breaker
Say it ain't so
My love is a life taker</b>


I can't confront you
I never could do
That which might hurt you
So try and be cool

<i>When I say
This way is a water slide away from me
That takes you further every day
So be cool</i>

<b>CHORUS</b>

Dear daddy
I write you in spite of years of silence
You've cleaned up, found Jesus, things are good or so I hear
This bottle of Steven's awakens ancient feelings
Like father, stepfather, the son is drowning in the flood
