- fix wide/tall mode.
  - The wide mode should maximize text size so that the max. text width (of the lyrics or the tabs) = max screen width. Wide mode is meant to be used on small screens as it maximizes text size.
  - The tall mode (default) should make sure the whole lyrics fit vertically on the same page (no need to scroll up or down).
  - In the tall mode, if there is enough space, try to split the lyrics in columns. The goal is to maximize text size while fitting everything on the screen.
- Consider zoom buttons  that would put stuff side by side if enough space (I.e., in different columns)
- Make sure it works from phone
- Add tag section with filterable tags like : easy, french, ukulele, Japan 2022 etc.
- Add colored lyrics + colored chords
- if you click on the chords, it shows the guitar + ukulele schema
- Make it so that song pages are accessible via a url var "artist + song"
