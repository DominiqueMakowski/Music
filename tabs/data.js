Well, I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind
I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time
But I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
I feel there's nothing I can do, yeah

I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
After all I knew, it had to be something to do with you
I really don't mind what happens now and then
As long as you'll be my friend at the end

<b>If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite</b>

You called me strong, you called me weak
But still your secrets, I will keep
You took for granted all the times, I never let you down
You stumbled in and bumped your head
If not for me then you'd be dead
I picked you up and put you back on solid ground

25 years and my life is still
Tryin' to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination

I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
For whatever that means

And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out what's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar

And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
"What's going on?"

<b>And I say, hey-ey-ey, Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey, 
what's going on?"

Oh my God, do I try
I try all the time

Hello, how are you?

I hope that you're well

Are running out of time

He was a boy, She was a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
He was a punk, She did ballet
What more can I say?

He wanted her, She'd never tell
Secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends, Stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes

<b>He was a skater boy
She said, "See you later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face
But her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to earth [Bb]</b>

Five years from now, She sits at home
Feeding the baby, she's all alone
She turns on TV, Guess who she sees
Skater boy rockin' up MTV

She calls up her friends, They already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along, And stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down

<b>He was a skater boy
She said, "See you later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a super star
Slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?
[Bb]</b>

<i>Sorry, girl, but you missed out
Well, tough, luck that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends
This is how the story ends
Too bad that you couldn't see
See the man that boy could be
There is more that meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside</i>

<i>He's just a boy
And I'm just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
We are in love
Haven't you heard
How we rock each other's world</i>

<b>I'm with the skater boy
I said, "See you later, boy"
I'll be back stage after the show
I'll be at a studio
Singing the song we wrote
About a girl he used to know

Pour oublier cette nuit à se taire à se tordre
Elle se taillade les veines, les veines

<i>Tu souris et tu paies, tu paies
Chaque fois c'est un peu pareil

There lived a certain man in Russia long ago
He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear
But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear
He could preach the bible like a preacher
Full of ecstacy and fire
But he also was the kind of teacher
Women would desire

<b>Ra ra Rasputin
Lover of the Russian queen
There was a cat that really was gone
Ra ra Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on</b>

He ruled the Russian land and never mind the Czar
But the kasachok he danced really wunderbar
In all affairs of state he was the man to please
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze
For the queen he was no wheeler dealer
Though she'd heard the things he'd done
She believed he was a holy healer
Who would heal her son

<b>CHORUS</b> 

<i>[Spoken:]
But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger for power 
became known to more and more people, 
the demands to do something about this outrageous man 
became louder and louder.</i>

"This man's just got to go!" declared his enemies
But the ladies begged "Don't you try to do it, please"
No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms
Though he was a brute they just fell into his arms
Then one night some men of higher standing
Set a trap, they're not to blame
"Come to visit us" they kept demanding
And he really came

<b>Ra ra Rasputin
Lover of the Russian queen
They put some poison into his wine
Ra ra Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
He drank it all and he said "I feel fine"
Ra ra Rasputin
Lover of the Russian queen
They didn't quit, they wanted his head
Ra ra Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
And so they shot him till he was dead</b>

Oh, those russians.

we both kinda liked it"

But now your eyes see through me
I guess I was wrong

So what now? It's plain to see we're over
And I hate when things are over

This life has many shades
I'd wake up every morning and before I'd start each day

Down a little something and then be on my way

I traveled far and wide
And laid this head in many ports
I was guided by a compass
I saw beauty to the north
I drew the tales of many lives
And wore the faces of my own
I had these memories all around me
So I wouldn't be alone

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance" (D)

I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?

She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Cèilidh singing to trad tunes

I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet
A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

With my pretty little Galway Girl x4</b>

And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night

I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write

How can you see into my eyes, like open doors
Leading you down into my core
Where I've become so numb, 
without a soul
My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home

<b>(Wake me up)
Wake me up inside 
(I can't wake up)
Wake me up inside
(Save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark,
(Wake me up)
Bid my blood to run, 
(I can't wake up)
Before I come undone,
(Save me)
Save me from the nothing I've become</b>

Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real, bring me to life

<b>CHORUS (C - D - Em)
Bring me to life, 
(I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside),
Bring me to life</b>

<i>Frozen inside without your touch
Without your love, darling
Only you are the life among the dead</i>

<i>(rap)
All this time, I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems
I've got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
Don't let me die here
There must be something wrong</i>

(Am - D) Bring me to life

<b>CHORUS (C - D - E)
Bring me to life,

a z jęków ich wesołą składał pieśń.
To przecież on dziś ojców naszych gnieci,
i każe im komuny jarzmo nieść.

To przecież on w katyńskim ciemnym lesie
wbił w polską pierś znienacka ostry nóż,
mordując tam najlepszych polskich synów
jak podły zbir, nikczemny zdrajca, tchórz.
To przecież on jak bóstwo czci Stalina
kapłanom twym nie szczędząc srogich mąk.
To przecież on z kościołów zrobił kina
i depcze krzyż, czerwoną gwiazdę czcząc.

To przecież on nie wierzyć w Boga zmusza
tumaniąc nas potęgą krasnych szmat,
by człowieczeństwo w sercu twoim zgasło,
byś ty nie wiedział, co to znaczy brat.
To przecież on zrabował twoje mienie
i krew serdeczną sączy z naszych ran.
On przecież psa niż ciebie więcej ceni
boś Polak jest -- więc wróg i polski pan.

To przecież on braterstwa głosząc hasła
do więzień pcha młodzieży naszej kwiat.
by człowieczeństwo w sercu twoim zgasło,
byś ty nie wiedział, co to znaczy brat.
Zasłonę więc zrzuć z oczu miły bracie,
Niech zagrzmi znów praojców złoty róg.

And all that I can see

I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning, turning, turning, turning
Turning around
And all that I can see

Sing dah-dah

I'm sitting here, I miss the power
I'd like to go out, taking a shower
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
I feel so tired, put myself into bed
Well, nothing ever happens
And I wonder

Isolation, I don't want to
Sit on a lemon tree</i>

I'm steppin' around in a desert of joy
Maybe anyhow I'll get another toy
And everything will happen
And you wonder
